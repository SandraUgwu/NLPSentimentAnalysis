# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Application for Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and report for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application developed as part of an academic assignment. The project uses machine learning and deep learning models to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Kindle book reviews.

## Project Description

The project aims to explore traditional and deep learning approaches to NLP by building a sentiment analysis system. This system classifies customer reviews as positive or negative based on their text content. 

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Amazon Kindle Book Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/amazon-kindle-book-review-for-sentiment-analysis)
- **Description**:
  - Contains customer reviews and associated sentiment labels (positive/negative).
  - Dataset properties:
    - **Size**: [Provide number of rows and columns, e.g., 200,000 rows and 3 columns].
    - **Columns**:
      - `Review`: The textual content of the review.
      - `Sentiment`: The sentiment label (positive or negative).
  - **Suitability**: This dataset is ideal for sentiment analysis as it is labeled and structured, allowing for supervised learning.

## Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization).
   - Analysis of class balance and text patterns.
2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implemented Naive Bayes and K-Means clustering for sentiment classification.
3. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - Developed LSTM and Transformer-based models for advanced sentiment analysis.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics used: F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Precision-Recall curves.

## Results

- Comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models:
  - Traditional models: [Add accuracy, F1-score, etc.]
  - Deep learning models: [Add accuracy, F1-score, etc.]
